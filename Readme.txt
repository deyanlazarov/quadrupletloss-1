00,01,02 work on 3xloss. 02 can be reused for MNIST dataprep


10 dummy dataset quick try with 4xloss without learned metric (converged but not interesting)
11 same than 10 with mining strategy (converged but not interesting)
12 same than 11 with MNIST. converged but embedding of 2 seems too tight
13 dummy dataset 3xloss vs 3xloss with learned metric. Converged
17 dummy dataset 3x vs 4x (full version) with mining. alphas=(0.1 0.1) Doesnt converge 
18 dummy dataset 3x vs 4x (full version) with mining. alphas=(0.1 0.01) converged but need to recheck 
19 dummy dataset 3x vs 4x (full version) with mining. alphas=(0.1 0.05) Doesnt converge
